# Keras-House-Price-Prediction-Model
In this project I created a model that predicts the price of a particular house based on it's features(eg: number of- square feet's, bathrooms, bedrooms, floors, year built, year renovated, zipcode etc.). This way, in the future when a person want's to sell/buy a house, he/she can predict it's price using our model and use it to cross reference it with that of the realtor's price.
